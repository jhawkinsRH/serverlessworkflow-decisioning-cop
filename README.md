Serverless WorkFlow Community of Practice

Serverless workflow refers to a workflow or business process that is executed in a serverless computing environment. Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of computing resources needed to run an application or service. This means that the user does not have to provision and manage servers, but instead can focus on writing and deploying their code.

Kogito is a cloud-native business automation toolkit that allows developers to create and run serverless workflows using various programming languages such as Java, Kotlin, and Quarkus. Kogito uses the Kubernetes container orchestration system and the Knative eventing system to provide a fully managed, scalable, and event-driven workflow engine.
